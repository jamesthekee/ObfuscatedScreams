# ObfuscatedScreams
Heavily obfuscated, computationally heavy and overly engineered program to print a custom string.

## Techniques used:

- Bespoke approximate formula f(x) to generate char f(x) at index x.
- Use of lambda func p to give nth prime
- Combined this function p, by multiplying, adding and composing to generate constants in the formula/ general expression.
- Used the python ellipsis object (...) and the (.) notation to get its attributes for a confusing looking expression.
- Used the os.write method instead of usual print.
- Used __import__ as onelining alternative for import
